# Results of layers after histogram specification

Results of applying layers become significantly worse. This is due to distortion of the color scheme of original images. Doing a specification with just a facial image will give facial tone to the whole image whihc will distort the behaviour of binary layers. To achieve better results one can do specification only on a bounding box that approximately contains the face on the original image.
